    "### Fraud Case 3: An increase in claim volume\n",
    "Rapid invoice volume increases may indicate that fraudster has become more confident in stealing money. One way to identify this type of fraud is to calculate the percentage of increase in claims compared to first month. For example, if a person submitted 5 claims in the first month and 25 in another, the percentage of increase compared to the first month is 400%. To explore the data set for any fraud of this nature, write a program that\n",
    "- finds a list of unique claimants (`uploader` column)\n",
    "- loops through the list of unique claimants and for each claimant\n",
    "   * finds all the submitted claims\n",
    "   * find all the months in which claimant made a claim\n",
    "   * loop through the months and count the number of claims per month\n",
    "   * calculate the percentage of increase compared to the first month\n",
    "   * checks if the percentage of increase in claim volume is larger than a threshold (letâ€™s assume 500%) in any month\n",
    "   * prints a message for further investigation if the percentage of increase is above the threshold\n",
    "   * visualizes the percentage of increase by month for the suspicious claimants"
